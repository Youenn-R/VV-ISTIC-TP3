# Validation and Verification: Practical Session #3

In this practical session, you will implement tests using different tools (jUnit, Mockito) and evaluate the quality of those tests (PMD, PIT).
After this session you should be able to write test suites and evaluate the quality of those tests using different techniques.

## Exercises

You can access the exercises [here](sujet.md)

## Lab implementation

Ce TP a été réalisé par Olivia Proust et Youenn Robitzer

## Deliverable and evaluation

We will mark this lab. You need to fork this repository and to submit a pull request with the answers directly here (deadline December 20th 2024, 23:59).

Note : To be taken into account for grading, the title of the pull request must be formatted as follows {LAST_NAME1}{FIRST_NAME1}&{LAST_NAME2}_{FIRST_NAME2}  
If you want to remain anonymous on github, you can use a pseudonym if you communicate it to your lab teacher {PSEUDO1}&{PSEUDO2}.
